Part 1:

Read from a file, each line is a command and its args

Take an input file, get number of lines. Does the token function give us this?

For each line in the array, fork()

Attempt to exec this line. 

-> pull from prev proj

For each command, MCP must launch a separate process to run the command:
fork() the proc
an exec() variant to run it

-> pull from lab 1

Once all proc's are running, MCP should wait for each to terminate
using a wait() variant

-> pull from lab 1

After all proc's termainate, MCP must use exit()

-> pos lab 2
